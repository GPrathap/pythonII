        "In this module, we are going to focus on learning the main tools/libraries that are being used in data analysis. The umbrella term for this set of libraries is SciPy which is a set of open-source Python libraries specialized for scientific computing. Together they constitute a set of tools for calculating and displaying data. Among the libraries that are part of the SciPy group, there are three in particular that are discussed in this Python II module.\n",

        "Numpy, whose name means numerical Python, contains the core of many other Python libraries that have originated from it. NumPy can be introduced as the foundation library for scientific computing in Python since it provides data structures and high-performing functions that the basic package of Python cannot provide. Knowledge of this library is essential in terms of numerical calculations since its correct use can greatly influence the performance of your computations. This library is known for its efficient handling of complex data by using reshaping, masking, sorting, slicing, and stacking.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pandas package provides complex data structures and functions specifically designed to make the work on piles of data easy, fast, and effective. This package is the core of data analysis in Python. Pandas apply the high-performance properties of the NumPy library to the manipulation of data in spreadsheets or in relational databases which come as dictionaries, series, or data series. In fact, by using sophisticated indexing, it will be easy to carry out many operations on this kind of data structure, such as merging, slicing, pivoting, and the selection of subsets using groupBy operations.\n",

        "Matplotlib is the Python library that is currently most popular for producing plots and other data visualizations in 2D. Since data analysis requires visualization tools, this is the library that best suits this purpose. This library enables us to generate plots and other types of charts with just a few lines of code and even enables handling data with different distributions. This library is providing the ability to showcase different aspects regardless of their complexity by providing a wide range of plots such as line, bar, pie,  scatter, histogram, and time series.\n",
